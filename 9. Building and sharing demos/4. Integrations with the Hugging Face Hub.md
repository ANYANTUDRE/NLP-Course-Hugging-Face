# Integrations with the Hugging Face Hub
To make your life even easier, Gradio integrates directly with Hugging Face Hub and Hugging Face Spaces. You can load demos from the Hub and Spaces with only one line of code.

## Loading models from the Hugging Face Hub
To start with, choose one of the thousands of models Hugging Face offers through the Hub.

Using the special Interface.load() method, you pass "model/" (or, equivalently, "huggingface/") followed by the model name. For example, here is the code to build a demo for GPT-J, a large language model, add a couple of example inputs:

```python
import gradio as gr

title = "GPT-J-6B"
description = "Gradio Demo for GPT-J 6B, a transformer model trained using Ben Wang's Mesh Transformer JAX. 'GPT-J' refers to the class of model, while '6B' represents the number of trainable parameters. To use it, simply add your text, or click one of the examples to load them. Read more at the links below."
article = "<p style='text-align: center'><a href='https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax' target='_blank'>GPT-J-6B: A 6 Billion Parameter Autoregressive Language Model</a></p>"

gr.Interface.load(
    "huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B",
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=5, label="Input Text"),
    title=title,
    description=description,
    article=article,
).launch()
```
