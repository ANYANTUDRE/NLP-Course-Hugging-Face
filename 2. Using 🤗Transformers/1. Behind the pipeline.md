# Behind the pipeline

The ü§ó Transformers library goal is to provide a single API through which any Transformer model can be loaded, trained, and saved.   
It's main features are:
- **Ease of use:** Downloading, loading, and using a state-of-the-art NLP model for inference can be done in just two lines of code.
- **Flexibility:** At their core, all models are simple PyTorch nn.Module or TensorFlow tf.keras.Model classes and can be handled like any other models in their respective machine ML frameworks.
- **Simplicity:** Hardly any abstractions are made across the library. The ‚ÄúAll in one file‚Äù is a core concept: a model‚Äôs forward pass is entirely defined in a single file, so that the code itself is understandable and hackable.  


As we saw in [Chapter 1](https://github.com/ANYANTUDRE/NLP-Course-Hugging-Face/blob/main/1.%20Transformer%20models/1.Transformers%2C%20what%20can%20they%20do_.md), this pipeline groups together three steps: **preprocessing**, passing the inputs through the **model**, and **postprocessing**:
![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/full_nlp_pipeline.svg)


## Preprocessing with a tokenizer

The first step of our pipeline is to convert the raw text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a **tokenizer**, which will be responsible for:

- **Splitting the input** into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called **tokens**,
- **Mapping each token to an integer,**
- **Adding additional inputs** that may be useful to the model.

All this preprocessing needs to be done in exactly the same way as when the model was pretrained, so we first need to download that information from the Model Hub. 
To do this, we use the **AutoTokenizer** class and its `from_pretrained()` method. 
Using the checkpoint name of our model, it will automatically fetch the data associated with the model‚Äôs tokenizer and cache it.

Let's run the following for sentiment-analysis:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
```

Once we have the tokenizer, we can directly pass our sentences to it and we‚Äôll get back a dictionary that‚Äôs ready to feed to our model! The only thing left to do is to convert the list of input IDs to tensors.

You can use ü§ó Transformers without having to worry about which ML framework is used as a backend; it might be PyTorch or TensorFlow, or Flax for some models. However, Transformer models only accept tensors as input.

```python
raw_inputs = [
    "I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.",
    "I hate this so much!",
]
inputs = tokenizer(raw_inputs, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="tf")
print(inputs)
```
Here‚Äôs what the results look like as TensorFlow tensors:
```

```

The output itself is a dictionary containing two keys, **input_ids** and **attention_mask**.   
- **input_ids:** contains two rows of integers (one for each sentence) that are the unique identifiers of the tokens in each sentence. 
- **attention_mask:** will be explained later in this chapter.


## Going through the model
We can download our pretrained model the same way we did with our tokenizer. ü§ó Transformers provides an **TFAutoModel** class which also has a `from_pretrained` method:

```python
from transformers import TFAutoModel

checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
```

This architecture contains only the **base Transformer module**: given some inputs, it outputs what we‚Äôll call **hidden states**, also known as **features**. For each model input, we‚Äôll retrieve a **high-dimensional vector** representing the contextual understanding of that input by the Transformer model.

While these hidden states can be useful on their own, they‚Äôre usually inputs to another part of the model, known as **the head**. In [Chapter 1](https://github.com/ANYANTUDRE/NLP-Course-Hugging-Face/blob/main/1.%20Transformer%20models/1.Transformers%2C%20what%20can%20they%20do_.md), the different tasks could have been performed with the same architecture, but each of these tasks will have a different head associated with it.


## A high-dimensional vector?
The vector output by the Transformer module is usually large. It generally has **three dimensions**:
- **Batch size:** number of sequences processed at a time (2 in our example).
- **Sequence length:** length of the numerical representation of the sequence (16 in our example).
- **-Hidden size:** vector dimension of each model input.
It is said to be **‚Äúhigh dimensional‚Äù** because of the last value. The hidden size can be very large (768 is common for smaller models, and in larger models this can reach 3072 or more).


We can see this if we feed the inputs we preprocessed to our model:
```python
outputs = model(inputs)
print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
```

Note that the outputs of ü§ó Transformers models behave like **namedtuples or dictionaries**. You can access the elements by attributes (like we did) or by key (outputs["last_hidden_state"]), or even by index if you know exactly where the thing you are looking for is (outputs[0]).


## Model heads: Making sense out of numbers
The model heads take the high-dimensional vector of hidden states as input and project them onto a different dimension. They are usually composed of **one or a few linear layers**:
![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter2/transformer_and_head.svg)

The output of the Transformer model is sent directly to the model head to be processed.

In this diagram, the model is represented by its embeddings layer and the subsequent layers. The embeddings layer converts each input ID in the tokenized input into a vector that represents the associated token. The subsequent layers manipulate those vectors using the attention mechanism to produce the final representation of the sentences.

There are many different architectures available in ü§ó Transformers, with each one designed around tackling a specific task. Here is a non-exhaustive list:
- *Model (retrieve the hidden states)
- *ForCausalLM
- *ForMaskedLM
- *ForMultipleChoice
- *ForQuestionAnswering
- *ForSequenceClassification
- *ForTokenClassification
- and others ü§ó

For our example, we will need a model with a sequence classification head (to be able to classify the sentences as positive or negative). So, we won‚Äôt actually use the TFAutoModel class, but TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification:
```python
from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification

checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
outputs = model(inputs)
```

Now if we look at the shape of our outputs, the dimensionality will be much lower: the model head takes as input the high-dimensional vectors we saw before, and outputs vectors containing two values (one per label):

```python
print(outputs.logits.shape)
```

```
Since we have just two sentences and two labels, the result we get from our model is of shape 2 x 2.

```python
print(outputs.logits)
```
Our model predicted [-1.5607, 1.6123] for the first sentence and [ 4.1692, -3.3464] for the second one. Those are not probabilities but logits, the raw, unnormalized scores outputted by the last layer of the model. To be converted to probabilities, they need to go through a SoftMax layer (all ü§ó Transformers models output the logits, as the loss function for training will generally fuse the last activation function, such as SoftMax, with the actual loss function, such as cross entropy):

```python
import tensorflow as tf

predictions = tf.math.softmax(outputs.logits, axis=-1)
print(predictions)
```
Now we can see that the model predicted [0.0402, 0.9598] for the first sentence and [0.9995, 0.0005] for the second one. These are recognizable probability scores.

To get the labels corresponding to each position, we can inspect the id2label attribute of the model config (more on this in the next section):

```python
model.config.id2label
```
```

```

Now we can conclude that the model predicted the following:

First sentence: NEGATIVE: 0.0402, POSITIVE: 0.9598
Second sentence: NEGATIVE: 0.9995, POSITIVE: 0.0005

We have successfully reproduced the three steps of the pipeline: preprocessing with tokenizers, passing the inputs through the model, and postprocessing! Now let‚Äôs take some time to dive deeper into each of those steps.
