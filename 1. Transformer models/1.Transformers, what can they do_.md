# Transformers, what can they do?
In this section, we will look at what **Transformer models** can do and use our first tool from the **🤗 Transformers** library: the `pipeline()` function.


Transformers are everywhere! Let’s look at a few examples of how they can be used to solve some interesting NLP problems.

## 🔗 Working with pipelines
The most basic object in the 🤗 Transformers library is the `pipeline()` function. We can directly input any text into it and get an intelligible answer.  
By default, this pipeline selects a particular **pretrained model** that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English. 

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier(["Nice, I've been waiting for short HuggingFace course my whole life!", "I hate this so much"])
```
```
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9984038472175598},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995144605636597}]
```

##### Steps
There are **three main steps** involved when you pass some text to a `pipeline()`:
- **Text preprocessing,**
- **Model prediction,**
- **Output post-processing**.

##### Other pipelines 🥤
Some of the currently available pipelines are:
- **feature-extraction**
- **fill-mask**
- **ner (named entity recognition)**
- **question-answering**
- **sentiment-analysis**
- **summarization**
- **text-generation**
- **translation**
- **zero-shot-classification**


## 🎯 Zero-shot classification 🔫  
The `zero-shot-classification` pipeline is very powerful for tasks where we need to **classify texts that haven’t been labelled.** It returns probability scores for any list of labels you want!  
It's called **zero-shot** because you don’t need to fine-tune the model on your data to use it. 

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
classifier("This is a short course about the Transformers library", 
            candidate_labels=["education", "politics", "business"],)
```
```
{'sequence': 'This is a short course about the Transformers library',
 'labels': ['education', 'business', 'politics'],
 'scores': [0.7481650114059448, 0.17828474938869476, 0.07355023920536041]}
```

##### Control 🎛️
- `candidate_labels`


## 📝 Text generation
The main idea here is that you provide a prompt and the model will auto-complete it by generating the remaining text.

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation")
generator("In this course, we will teach you how to")
```
```
[{'generated_text': 'In this course, we will teach you how to create the appropriate and easy-to-use, user-friendly website, without having to go far to change your password. We will also explain and explain the principles and the tools that developers use for'}]
```

##### Control 🎛️
- `max_length`: total length of the output text.
- `num_return_sequences`: number of returning sequences.

## 🗂 Using any model from the Hub in a pipeline
The previous examples used the **default model** for the task at hand, but you can also choose a particular model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) to use in a pipeline for a specific task — say, text generation.  

Let’s try the [distilgpt2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilgpt2) model!

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2")
generator( "In this course, we will teach you how to",
           max_length=30,
           num_return_sequences=2,
)
```
```
[{'generated_text': 'In this course, we will teach you how to use your hands to manage your time of day by giving feedback and tips and teaching each day.\n'},
 {'generated_text': 'In this course, we will teach you how to use the Java Virtual Machine for creating your Java application. We’ll teach you how to use'}]
```

## ❎ Mask filling
The idea of this task is to **fill in the blanks** in a given text:

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

unmasker = pipeline("fill-mask")
unmasker("This course will teach you all about <mask> models.", top_k=2)
```
```
[{'score': 0.1961979866027832,
  'token': 30412,
  'token_str': ' mathematical',
  'sequence': 'This course will teach you all about mathematical models.'},
 {'score': 0.04052741825580597,
  'token': 38163,
  'token_str': ' computational',
  'sequence': 'This course will teach you all about computational models.'}]
```

##### Control 🎛️
- `top_k argument`: controls how many possibilities you want to be displayed. 
- `<mask>`: mask token or special word the model must fills in. It depends on the used model.


## 🧩 Named entity recognition (NER)
NER is a task where the model has to find which parts of the input text correspond to **entities such as persons, locations, or organizations.**  

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

ner = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)
ner("My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn.")
```
```
[{'entity_group': 'PER',
  'score': 0.9981694,
  'word': 'Sylvain',
  'start': 11,
  'end': 18},
 {'entity_group': 'ORG',
  'score': 0.9796019,
  'word': 'Hugging Face',
  'start': 33,
  'end': 45},
 {'entity_group': 'LOC',
  'score': 0.9932106,
  'word': 'Brooklyn',
  'start': 49,
  'end': 57}]
```

Here the model correctly identified that Sylvain is a **person (PER)**, Hugging Face an **organization (ORG)**, and Brooklyn a **location (LOC)**.  

##### Control 🎛️
- `grouped_entities=True`: regroup together the parts of the sentence that correspond to the same entity (grouping “Hugging” and “Face” as a single organization)


## ⁉️ Question answering
The **question-answering** pipeline answers questions using information from a given context.

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

question_answerer = pipeline("question-answering")
question_answerer(
            question="Where do I work?",
            context="My name is Sylvain and I work at Hugging Face in Brooklyn",
)
```
```
{'score': 0.694976270198822, 'start': 33, 'end': 45, 'answer': 'Hugging Face'}
```


## 📜 Summarization
**Summarization** is the task of reducing a text into a shorter text while keeping all (or most) of the important aspects referenced in the text. 

##### Example 👾
```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
summarizer(
    """
    America has changed dramatically during recent years. Not only has the number 
    of graduates in traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, civil, 
    electrical, chemical, and aeronautical engineering declined, but in most of 
    the premier American universities engineering curricula now concentrate on 
    and encourage largely the study of engineering science. As a result, there 
    are declining offerings in engineering subjects dealing with infrastructure, 
    the environment, and related issues, and greater concentration on high 
    technology subjects, largely supporting increasingly complex scientific 
    developments. While the latter is important, it should not be at the expense 
    of more traditional engineering.

    Rapidly developing economies such as China and India, as well as other 
    industrial countries in Europe and Asia, continue to encourage and advance 
    the teaching of engineering. Both China and India, respectively, graduate 
    six and eight times as many traditional engineers as does the United States. 
    Other industrial countries at minimum maintain their output, while America 
    suffers an increasingly serious decline in the number of engineering 
    graduates and a lack of well-educated engineers.
"""
)
```

```
[{'summary_text': ' China and India graduate six and eight times as many traditional engineers as the U.S. does . Rapidly developing economies such as India and Europe continue to encourage and advance the teaching of engineering . America suffers an increasingly serious decline in the number of engineering graduates and a lack of well-educated engineers .'}]
```
##### Control 🎛️
Same as text generation:
- `max_length`
- `min_length`


## 🈵 Translation
For translation, you can use a default model if you provide a language pair in the task name (such as "`translation_en_to_fr`"), but the easiest way is to pick the model you want to use on the Model Hub.

##### Example 👾
Translating from French to English:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

translator = pipeline("translation", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-fr-en")
translator("Ce cours est produit par Hugging Face.")
```

```
[{'translation_text': 'This course is produced by Hugging Face.'}]
```

##### Control 🎛️
Same as text generation & summarization:
- `max_length`
- `min_length`


The pipelines shown so far are mostly for demonstrative purposes. They were programmed for specific tasks and cannot perform variations of them. In the next chapter, you’ll learn what’s inside a `pipeline()` function and how to customize its behavior.
